## Team Norms and Project values

## Git workflow
We will be using a simplified version of the [workflow described here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
* The `master` branch at `origin` will only contain finalized code that is suitable for deployment and release
* There is a `develop` branch that exists parallel to the `master` where the `HEAD` always reflects a state with latest changes
* Each feature will have its own branch and are branched from the `develop` branch
* Do not merge anything into `main` without full group agreement and testing the `deploy` branch


## Rules for Contributing
* Each commit should have a commit message explaining what change was made. Contributors should commit for each units of change.
* If you're stuck and need help or advice, need someone to review your work, or want to add a change, use a pull request. This helps everyone keep track of these requests.


## Resolving Disagreements  
Disagreements and conflicts should be resolved independently and as soon as possible, and team members are always welcome to share their opinions and concerns with each other. The aim for every resolution should be a situation where all parties are satisfied and reach a consensus â€” and this does mean that everyone should be open and willing to converse and objectively strategize to reach such an outcome.
