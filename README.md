## Project description
Everyone knows that planning a trip involves lots of details and moving parts. Travel Wise is a web application that makes it easy for individuals and groups to make and keep track of their travel plans. Users can create polls and checklists and also receive recommendations for activities, hotels, flights, and much more based on budget, trip purpose, and interests. Users must create an account to access all functions of the application, which includes adding other users and forming group trips and keeping track of previous trip history.
